# TypeScript Starter Template for Node

**YATSTN** aka Yet Another TypeScript Starter Template for Node. Extremely barebones.

## Scripts

### `yarn start:dev`

Runs the app in development using [ts-node-dev](https://github.com/whitecolor/ts-node-dev) (watches for changes, builds incrementally).

### `yarn build`

Builds the app to `/build`, cleaning the folder first.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in production by first building the project with `yarn build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `/build/index.js`.
